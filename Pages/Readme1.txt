|               UVSim is a Command Line based Machine Language Simulator developed as an educational                  |
|               tool for the purpose of learning Machine Language. UVSim contains 1 register named                    |
|               "Accumulator", 15 instructions, and 100 lines of memory. The size a memory address can                |
|               hold is 4 long along with a sign denoting if it's positive or negative. UVSim also                    |
|               performs internal calculations up to 6 digits long. UVSim first opens in a menu. The                  |

|               load memory modules in the load menu, create memory modules in in Editing Mode, save                  |
|               memory files in the save menu, and run loaded memory in Execution Mode. In order to                   |
