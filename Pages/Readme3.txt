|     In Editing Mode, you will input your instructions line by line starting at line 00. Each lineyou provide        |
|     is positive or negative, even instructions. The opcode tells the simulator what instruction to do(a list        |
|     of each opcode and a description is listed below). The operand is dependent on the opcode, so refer to the      |
|     instruction list for information on each purpose. Since the memory is limited to 100 lines, you will only       |
|     be able to input instructions until line 99. When you want the program to finish at a particular line, be       |
|     sure to put a HALT instruction. To exit Editing Mode you can either fill all 99 lines, input -9999, or          |
|     input +9999 to save it while exiting. Either way, this memory will be staged to run in Execution Mode.          |
|                                                                                                                     |
|     Hint: You may want to reserve a block of lines for data, if so, you can use it as pure data, or you may want    |
|     to leave it empty increase you want to save data during execution.                                              |
|                                                                                                                     |
|     CAUTION: Be aware of the arithmetic you are asking the simulator to perform. Since each result is at max 6      |
|     digits, you may experience an overflow or underflow if the arithmetic results in a higher/lower digit number.   |
|     IE: Once it reaches the limit of 999999, it will wrap back to the other limit of -999999 and continue,          |
|     resulting in a false answer.                                                                                    |
