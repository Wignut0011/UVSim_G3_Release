|               UVSIM only supports one save file called Save.mem. In order to save your work from                    |
|               Editing Mode, go to the save menu and select save. You can only do this if you have a                 |
|               memory module already stagged. In order to load a memory module, go to the load menu and              |
|               select load. If you have not previously saved any work, or deleted the save, you cannot               |
|               access the load menu until you have a saved memory module. If you wish to redo an already             |
|               stagged memory module, go to the load menu and select the third option. Doing this will               |
|               erase your stagged memory and you can start again in Editing Mode.                                    |
