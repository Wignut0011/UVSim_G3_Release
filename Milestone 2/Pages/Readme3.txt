|     In Editing Mode, you will input your instructions line by line starting at line 00 as shown above. Each the     |
|     simulator if the data is positive or negative. The opcode tells the simulator what instruction to do (a         |
|     list of each opcode and a description is listed below). The operand is dependent on the opcode, so refer        |
|     to the instruction list for information on each purpose. Since the memory is limited to 100 lines, you will     |
|     only be able to input instructions until line 99. When you want the program to finish at a particular line,     |
|     be sure to put a HALT instruction. To exit Editing Mode you can either fill all 99 lines or input -9999.        |
|     Doing this will put UVSim into Execution Mode.                                                                  |
|                                                                                                                     |
|     Hint: You may want to reserve a block of lines for data, if so, you can use it as pure data, or you may want    |
|     to leave it empty increase you want to save data during execution.                                              |
|                                                                                                                     |
|     CAUTION: Be aware of the arithmetic you are asking the simulator to perform. Since each word is limited to 4    |
|     digits, you may experience an overflow or underflow if the arithmetic results in a higher/lower digit number.   |
|     IE: Once it reaches the limit of +9999, it will wrap back to the other limit of -9999 and continue, resulting   |
|     in a false answer.                                                                                              |
