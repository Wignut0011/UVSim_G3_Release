|          In order to start this mode, you need to have a staged memory module. If no memory module                  |
|          has been staged, you can't run this mode yet. To have a module staged, you either have to                  |
|          create one in Editing Mode or load one.                                                                    |
|                                                                                                                     |
|          Once in Execution Mode, the simulator will start to execute the instructions in the staged                 |
|          memory module. Depending on your instructions, you may be prompted to input a number during                |
|          it's runtime. Once a HALT instruction has been reached, or line 99 had been executed,                      |
|          Execution Mode will end and a dump of the memory and each register will be printed on the                  |
|          screen. If you see memory addresses with ++xxxx or --xxxx, this denotes a 6 digit word so                  |
|          read pairs of these addresses as one digit. IE: ++0003 ++1234 would be "31234". Once you are               |
|          done reviewing the dump, you will be put back into the main menu.                                          |
